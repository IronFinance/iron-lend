# IronLend
IronLend is the fork of Compound Finance Lending protocol, with a few minor changes:
- Using price oracles with 100% ChainLink Price feeds instead of Compound's open price feeds.
- Directly mint reward token (ICE) from Controller instead of transfer reward tokens from Controller to claimers.
- Remove some reward features related to Contributors which is not relevant to Iron Finance
